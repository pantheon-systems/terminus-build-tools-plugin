## Project Purpose
The main purposes of the Build Tools project are to:

**Ease the creation of new projects making use of an external Git provider, a Continuous Integration service, and Pantheon.**
This is primarily done through the [`build:project:create` commands](#buildprojectcreate), which scaffolds new projects from a [template repository](#template-repositories) and performs one-time setup, such as configuring SSH keys and environment variables, needed to connect an external Git provider and CI service with Pantheon. For detailed set-up instructions, see the [Terminus Build Tools Guide](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/). To use your own template repository see [Customization](#customization).

**Add additional commands to Terminus to make tasks common in an automated CI workflow easier.**
See [Commands](#commands) and [Build Tools Command Examples](#build-tools-command-examples) for details.

## Requirements

- If you are using Terminus 2, you must use the Build Tools `2.x` release
- If you are using Terminus 1, you must use [the Build Tools `1.x` release](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin/tree/1.x). Note that Terminus 1 is nearing [End of Life](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates#eol-timeline) and version 2 is recommended.

PHP `7.2` or greater is recommended.

## Installation

### Installing Build Tools 2.x:

```
mkdir -p ~/.terminus/plugins
composer create-project --no-dev -d ~/.terminus/plugins pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin:^2.0.0
```

### Installing Build Tools 1.x:

```
mkdir -p ~/.terminus/plugins
composer create-project --no-dev -d ~/.terminus/plugins pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin:^1
```

### Note about dev dependencies

The Terminus Build Tools plugin should be installed **without** dev dependencies. If you install the plugin with a different method, such as cloning this source repository, use `composer install --no-dev` to download the project dependencies.

## Setup

It is recommended that you use one of the provided example projects as a template when creating a new project. All of the example projects use Terminus `2` and Build Tools `2.x`.

The default template repositories are each assigned an abbreviation, as shown below:

- [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer): `wp`
- [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer): `d8`
- [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-7-composer): `d7`

More details about these template repositories see [Template Repositories](#template-repositories) in this document or visit the links above.

You can get started with one of these examples by using the `build:project:create` command:
```
$ terminus build:project:create --team='My Agency Name' wp my-site
```
This command will create:

- A Pantheon site
- A GitHub repository
- A CircleCI test configuration

It will prompt you for the credentials it needs to create these assets. While GitHub and CircleCI are the defaults, other providers are supported as well. See [available services](available-services) for details.

Note: After running this command, if you get an error "There are no commands defined in the "build:project" namespace", then you may need to install this Terminus plugin first as described in [Requirements](#requirements), above.

Note: It is important to specify the name of your agency organization via the `--team` option. If you do not do this, then your new site will be associated with your user and will not have the capability to create multidev environments.

## Available Services

The `build:project:create` command supports services in the following combination: 

| Git Host  | CI Service |
| --------- | ---------- |
| GitHub    | CircleCI   |
| GitLab    | GitLabCI   |
| BitBucket | CircleCI   |

### Starting a new GitLab Project

```
$ terminus build:project:create --git=gitlab --team='My Agency Name' wp my-site
```

### Starting a new BitBucket Project

```
$ terminus build:project:create --git=bitbucket --team='My Agency Name' wp my-site
```

#### Limitations

## Customization

You may easily create your own project template by forking one of the Pantheon maintained examples (linked above) and customizing it to suit your needs. To use a custom starter, register your project on Packagist, and then use the projects org/name with the `build:project:create` command:
```
$ terminus build:project:create --team='My Agency Name' my-project/my-starter my-site
```
See [Starter Site Shortcuts](#starter-site-shortcuts) below for instructions on defining your own shortcuts for your starter projects.


### Configuration

Configuration values for the Terminus Build Tools Plugin may be stored in your Terminus Configuration file, located at `~/.terminus/config.yml`. This is especially useful for agencies who would like every site created within their Pantheon team.

#### Default Values for Options

Terminus configuration is based on the [Robo PHP configuration system](http://robo.li/getting-started/#configuration). Default option values for Terminus commands can be defined in the same way as other Robo applications. For example, the options for the command `build:project:create` are stored in the section `command:` > `build:` > `project:` > `create:` > `options:`. The example below provides default values for the `--admin-password` and `--team` options. 
```
command:
  build:
    project:
      create:
        options:
          admin-password: secret-secret
          team: My Pantheon Org
```

#### Self-Hosted GitLab

The GitLab URL used by Build Tools can be defined by updating the `build-tools:provider:git:gitlab:url` configuration value, as demonstrated by the example below. Note that you will need to replace `hostname` with the actual GitLab instance hostname.

```
build-tools:
  provider:
    git:
      gitlab:
        url: hostname
```

#### Starter Site Shortcuts

If you often create sites based on certain common starter sites, you may also use your Terminus configuration file to define custom starter site shortcuts. The example below defines shortcuts for the Lightning and Contenta distributions:
```
command:
  build:
    project:
      create:
        shortcuts:
          contenta: pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer:dev-contenta
``` 
Note that the project name follows the standard defined by Composer: `org-name` / `project-name` : dev- `branch-name`.

### Build Customizations

To customize this for a specific project:

- Define necessary environment variables within your CI provider:
  - TERMINUS_SITE: The name of the Pantheon site that will be used in testing.
  - TERMINUS_TOKEN: A Terminus OAuth token that has write access to the terminus site specified by TERMINUS_SITE.
  - GIT_EMAIL: Used to configure the git user’s email address for commits we make.
- Customize `dependencies:` as needed to install additional tools.
- Replace example `test:` section with commands to run your tests.
- [Add a `build-assets` script](https://pantheon.io/blog/writing-composer-scripts) to your composer.json file.

### PR Environments vs Other Test Environments

Note that using a single environment for each PR means that it is not possible to run multiple tests against the same PR at the same time. Currently, no effort is made to cancel running tests when a new one is kicked off; if the concurrent build is not cancelled before a new commit is pushed to the PR branch, then the two tests could potentially conflict with each other. If support for parallel tests on the same PR is desired, then it is possible to eliminate PR environments, and make all tests run in their own independent CI environment. To do this, configure your CI provider by **adding** the following environment variable:
```
    TERMINUS_ENV: $CI_LABEL
```
### Running Tests without Multidevs

To use this tool on a Pantheon site that does not have multidev environments support, it is possible to run all tests against the `dev` environment. If this is done, then it is not possible to run multiple tests at the same time. To use the `dev` environment, configure your CI provider by **adding** the following environment variable:
```
    TERMINUS_ENV: dev
```
** IMPORTANT NOTE: ** If you initially set up your site using `terminus build:project:create`, and you do **not** use the `--team` option, or the team you specify is not an Agency organization, then your configuration will automatically be set up to use only the dev environment. If you later add multidev capabilities to your site, you will need to edit the environment variables in your CI configuration and **delete** the entry for `TERMINUS_ENV`.

## Build Tools Command Examples

The examples below show how some of the other `build:env:` commands are used within test scripts. It is not usually necessary to run any of these commands directly; they may be of interest if you are customizing or building your own test scripts.

### Create Testing Multidev

`terminus build:env:create my-pantheon-site.dev ci-1234`

This command will commit the generated artifacts to a new branch and then create the requested multidev environment for use in testing.

### Push Code to the Dev Environment

`terminus build:env:push my-pantheon-site.dev`

This command will commit the generated artifacts to an existing multidev environment, or to the dev environment.

### Merge Testing Multidev into Dev Environment

`terminus build:env:merge my-pantheon-site.ci-1234`

### Delete Testing Multidevs

`terminus build:env:delete my-pantheon-site '^ci-' --keep=2 --delete-branch`

### List Testing Multidevs

`terminus build:env:list`

### Commenting on a pull request or merge request

`terminus build:comment:add:pr --pr_number=123 --message="Behat tests passed!"`

## Help
Run `terminus list build` for a complete list of available commands. Use `terminus help <command>` to get help on one command.

## Related Repositories

### Template Repositories

In addition to the Terminus Build Tools Plugin, Pantheon maintains template repositories for:

- [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer)
- [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer)
- [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-7-composer)

Each repository includes an opinionated set of workflows and deployment scripts. These templates are meant to be a one-time starting point for new projects and customized as needed. Improvements made over time must be manually applied to existing projects. These are examples, **not** frameworks.

### Build Tools CI Dockerfile

Pantheon maintains a [Build Tools CI Dockerfile](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/docker-build-tools-ci/), which is deployed to [`quay.io`](https://quay.io/repository/pantheon-public/build-tools-ci?tab=tags), for use in Continuous Integration environments. It contains common Pantheon tools, such as Terminus and the Terminus Build Tools plugin. The deployed image tags follow semantic versioning.

### Quicksilver Pushback

[Quicksilver pushback](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-pushback/) is a project that makes use of Pantheon's [Quicksilver Webhooks](https://pantheon.io/docs/quicksilver) to apply code commits made on Pantheon to an external Git provider.
